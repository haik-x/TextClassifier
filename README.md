# TextClassifier


TextClassifier is a tool to help users classify their text without having to read their content. 

The API receives a text as an input and produces a label of the topic of the text as an output. 

## Installation


The repository needs to be downloaded or cloned to a location accessible to you. To install it simply do the following from your terminal:
