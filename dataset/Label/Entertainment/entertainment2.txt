Prepare to be transported back to the desert planet of Arrakis in the new “Dune: Part Two” trailer, where Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Chani (Zendaya) are together at last.

The first official look at the long-awaited second installment of the sweeping sci-fi film series based on Frank Herbert’s iconic 1965 novel debuted on Wednesday, quenching viewers’ thirst for new “Dune” content after the first film was released in October 2021.

Director Denis Villeneuve promised the audience during the Warner Bros. Studios presentation at CinemaCon last week that “Dune: Part Two” is much more “action-packed” and an “epic war movie,” following the first film’s “contemplative” nature. By the looks of the trailer, his words ring true. (Warner Bros. Studios and CNN are all part of Warner Bros. Discovery.)
Chalamet and Zendaya are seen together in the trailer picking back up where they left off in the deep desert lands of Arrakis, as they navigate their characters’ love for each other while preparing for impending war.

“We really see Paul Atreides become a leader here,” Chalamet said at CinemaCon, after explaining that the first film saw his character more through the lens of a “student.”

We get a glimpse in the trailer of Atreides’ blue eyes, a transformation caused by his use of Spice, the planet’s most precious commodity that gives its user mystical powers. We’re even treated to clips of Atreides mounting a giant sandworm, and sharing a special kiss with Chani.
