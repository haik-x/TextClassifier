Former President Donald Trump is trying to move the New York criminal case regarding hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to federal court, saying the Manhattan district attorney’s charges are tied to Trump’s duties as president.

In a court filing Thursday, Trump’s lawyers also hinted at how they may defend the former president, arguing that the reimbursement payments made to then-personal attorney Michael Cohen were not falsified business records.
This case is unprecedented in our nation’s history,” the filing states. “Never before has a local elected prosecutor criminally prosecuted a defendant either for conduct that occurred entirely while the defendant was the sitting President of the United States or for conduct that related to federal campaign contribution laws.

Prosecutors allege that Trump falsified business records when he repaid Cohen for hush money payments made during the 2016 campaign to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies. Prosecutors allege the intent was to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information about Trump during the election. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges last month.
In Thursday’s filing, Trump’s attorneys wrote that the former president “denies these were false records.”

Trump “will assert that the statements in the purported business records at issue were in fact truthful statements because the money paid to Michael Cohen was, in part, ‘retainer’ or legal payments to Michael Cohen to act as President Trump’s personal attorney.”
