When Saúl ‘Canelo’ Álvarez steps out in front of a sold out Estadio Akron in his hometown of Guadalajara on Saturday night to fight John Ryder, it will feel like a full circle moment for the Mexican boxer.

For the first time in 12 years – since his November 2011 victory over Kermit Cintrón in Mexico City – Álvarez will be fighting on home soil and, in his words, returning home as “the best,” as he aims to defend his WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO super middleweight titles.

Since his first professional fight back in 2005, Álvarez has gone on to become one of the greatest pound-for-pound boxers in history, and even he is incredulous at what he has accomplished during an illustrious 18-year career.

“I feel very happy to be here, be able to offer this fight to my people, the people who saw me grow from the beginning,” Álvarez tells CNN en Español’s Javier Cardoso in Mexico.

"I am happy and proud to return as the best and to be able to offer them the experience that I’ve been living in other places, that they can experience this with me. It is an honor for me."

"Many things have happened [in my career] for the better and mistakes or not, it has always been for the better. I have achieved many things in my career that I never imagined.
Álvarez is undoubtedly one of Mexico’s greatest sporting exports."

Standing alongside him, though, is boxing legend Julio César Chávez, who in 1993 sold out the iconic Estadio Azteca for his WBC super lightweight title defense against Greg Haugen.

With more than 130,000 people in the stadium that day, it remains one of the biggest attendances in boxing history.

Now with a stadium sellout of his own – 50,000 fans are expected at the Estadio Akron on Cinco de Mayo weekend – Álvarez says he is “grateful” that he can “give this fight to the people.”
